# Mercyhurst Basketball Statistics Web Application

[Mercyhurst Basketball Statistic Web Application Link](https://jouegnin.shinyapps.io/mu_stats_project/)

For this project, I scrapped data from the Mercyhurst University  basketball team's website, for the 2010-2014 seasons. The two scripts built for scrapping are "link_name_scrapper" and "stat_scraper". 

My next step was to clean the data, which is found in the scripts "table_cleaner". Finally I created a master csv file named bstats, "bstats_builder".

Once I had all the data saved on a CSV file, I created a Shiny web application. The app let the user choose a season, player and the statistic one chooses to display.
